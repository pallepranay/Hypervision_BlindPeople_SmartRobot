Hypervision is a smart AI robotic stick for blind people

Robotics is one of the leading technologies in the world. Usage of robots has brought myriad remarkable changes in various sectors. Healthcare is one such sector where the robots are effectively being used. Blindness is a disability that affects millions of people worldwide, hindering their ability to navigate independently in their daily lives. So here we are with an assistive robot called “Hyperion” which helps in finding the path for blind.

Imagine walking blindfolded around your room. A sense of vulnerability catches you up albeit being in a familiar place. Then imagine the situation of blind where they have to walkthrough umpteen places which are unfamiliar to them. Horrible right? This constant thought has motivated us to come up with this robot.
